Hi Ed,
 
I hope this message finds you well.
 
Attached are the files you’ll need to update the website.
 
Also, please could you remove ‘The major new journal’ from the first sentence of the introduction in the homepage?
 
Thanks and best wishes,
Michelle

Subject: Files for Ed Hiley for MW web
 
 
Hi again, can you hold this until the end of the week in case the ladies make changes to the contents.
 
I will not send the Academia.edu pdf stuff until I know the files are cleared, the Editorial often changes at the last moment
 
 
however ...
 
Please check everything on the website for things that should be changed or updated.
Any links that need to be added/removed etc
 
and finally
 
Please send all requests to Ed at the same time.
 
Here are the cover pictures he needs, and the contents list as a word doc hopefully still how he likes it and hopefully correct, we will see!
 
and tell him he can contact me if needed

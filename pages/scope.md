*Moving Worlds* is a forum for creative work as well as criticism, literary as well as visual texts, writing in scholarly as well as more personal modes, in English and translations into English. It is open to experimentation, and represents work of different kinds and from different cultural traditions. It reappraises acknowledged achievements and promotes fresh talent. Its central concern – the transcultural – is the movement of cultures across national boundaries, and the productive transformations resulting from these crisscrossings. Its outreach is regional, national and international, that is, towards the diversity and richness of global/local communities.

*Moving Worlds* is a biannual international magazine. Each issue will highlight a particular theme and also carry material of general interest.

The journal is sustained by a sense of history – Leeds has a pioneering role in the field of Commonwealth and Postcolonial studies – and so is committed to the politics of resistance and reinvention in a post-imperial world. It is impelled by a keen awareness of the marked developments and changes which have taken place in the field in the last 30 years, in other words, a pressing need to explore new work, new directions and new perspectives…

Published by *Moving Worlds* at the School of English, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, UK, and School of Humanities and Social Sciences, NTU, Singapore. Contributions of unpublished material are invited. Books for notice are welcome.
